                        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian,
                        who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.
                        Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic
                        Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
